# EEG Beta Activity and Reading Comprehension

This project analyzes **beta oscillatory activity (13â€“30 Hz)** in the **prefrontal cortex (Fz, F4)** of EFL learners during **True/False reading comprehension tasks** using EEG data.

---

##  Objective
The goal of this study is to investigate how **beta band activity** reflects **attentional and cognitive control** during reading comprehension in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners.

---

##  Methods
- **Participants:** 30 intermediate EFL learners (based on Oxford Placement Test)
- **Task:** True/False reading comprehension test
- **EEG recording:** QEEG system, 19-channel cap, focusing on Fz and F4
- **Analysis:** FFT-based power analysis on beta and high-beta bands

---

##  Results 
- Significant increase in **high-beta power** at **F4** during task performance.
- Indicates stronger **attentional engagement** and **executive control**.

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- SPSS (for statistical analysis)
